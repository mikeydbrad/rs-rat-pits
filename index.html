  This is the index.html file for this rock/paper/scissors javascript project. It is meant to almost
  completely imitate the in-game UI for a game called Old School Runescape, 
  @ https://oldschool.runescape.com, by mimicking how the game's chat windows work and display.

  I actually just started playing this game again, and took a screenshot from the tutorial part of
  the game.

      replaced in subsequent rounds of the game.-->
